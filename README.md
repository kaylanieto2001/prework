## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [-] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [-] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [-] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [-] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [-] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [-] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [-] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [-] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [-] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [-] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [-] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used w3 schools to adjust the images to fit to the size of the button entirely as opposed to being zoomed in]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challenge I encountered while creating this submission was coding the game logic itself. I overcame this challenge by writing out what I want the code to do and then programming it to do such]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[One question I have is how can I make this webpage more accessible for mobile devices as well as screen readers. I find that the page itself looks very different when translated to the phone or a different device and was wondering how to go about fixing that. In addiiton, a question I have is how should I approach making a webpage look styled better with CSS. I have definitely struggled implementing a more aesthetically pleasing webpage in the past and am curious how to improve layout and structure.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on the project, I would implement levels (easy,medium, and hard) that would vary in difficulty in terms of pattern length as well as time for clue and time you have to guess the correct pattern. Another implementation I would include would be a win and lose screen with the option to try a harder or easier level for those pages based on how you originally did. These make the game more fun since it would vary in difficulty.
